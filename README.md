# Undocumented Steam WebAPI Methods

This repository is only meant to collect API methods, not their parameters.

If you want more information on how to use these, or what their parameters are,
you will have to dig and use Google yourself.

### [This repository is now archived, the list now lives in the SteamWebAPIDocumentation repository.](https://github.com/xPaw/SteamWebAPIDocumentation/blob/master/api_undocumented_methods.txt)
